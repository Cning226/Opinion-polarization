# Opinion-Polarization
This repo is for our paper *Nonlinear Polarization Modeling via Dual-Threshold Diffusion-Evolution Dynamics*, which is an opinion-evolution dynamics framework that couples diffusion models with evolutionary algorithms and is driven by a dual-threshold social-cognition mechanism. In the diffusion stage the framework continuously generates diverse opinions and, guided by a consensus-fitness function, highlights mainstream high-value views; in the denoising stage evolutionary selection preserves the fittest opinions and injects controllable perturbations to break information bubbles.
